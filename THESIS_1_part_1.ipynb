            "[eBron James—18-time NBA All-Star four-time NBA champion two-time Olympic gold medalist—has hit yet another milestone this time doing something no other NBA player has ever done. After totaling $121.2 million before taxes and agents’ fees over the last 12 months estimates that James has officially become a billionaire while still playing hoops. The 37-year-old superstar has a net worth of $1 billion by’ count. James who missed the playoffs this year for in 19 seasons is the first active NBA player to make the billionaires list. (Michael Jordan the only other basketball billionaire didn’t hit ten figures more than a decade after he retired thanks to a well-timed investment in the Charlotte Hornets basketball team.) “It’s my biggest milestone” James told GQ in. “Obviously. I want to maximize my business. And if I happen to get it if I happen to be a billion-dollar athlete ho. Hip hip hooray! Oh my God I’m gonna be excited.\" “It’s my biggest milestone obviously. I want to maximize my business. And if I happen to get it if I happen to be a billion-dollar athlete ho. Hip hip hooray! Oh my God I’m gonna be excited.” James has done just that: maximized his business to the tune of more than $1.2 billion in pretax earnings. He has commanded more than $385 million in salary from the Cleveland Cavaliers Miami Heat and Los Angeles Lakers as. Off the court he has raked in upwards of $900 million in income from endorsements and other business ventures. Born to a struggling 16-year-old single mother in Akron Ohio James lived with an assortment of family members friends neighbors and his peewee football coach before becoming the most hyped high school basketball prospect of all time. He inked his first deal with Nike in 2003 at age 18 famously rejecting offers fromand in favor of what he saw as the better long-term partner. Good call. After more than a decade of success he struck a lifetime agreement with Nike in late 2015 that pays him tens of millions annually. Over the past year thanks to Nike plus deals with brands like AT&T PepsiCo and Walmart he was the in the world. Paycheck to paycheck: James earned $64 million in four seasons with the Miami Heat; $153 million in four seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers his current squad; and $170 million in 11 seasons with the Cleveland Cavaliers. But the real key to James’ billion-dollar fortune: He’s been more than just a pitchman. James has long structured deals to give him equity in brands he partners with giving him a cut of the upside instead of a quick paycheck. In 2015 James walked away from an endorsement agreement with McDonald’s worth over four years to instead gamble on the fast-growing Blaze Pizza chain where he’s an investor. He’s taken equity in brands like smart gym-maker Tonal and ride-share giant Lyft as well. Then there’s SpringHill the TV and movie production outfit built by James and business partner Maverick Carter. Last October outside investors including Boston Red Sox owner Fenway Sports Group and Epic Games bought into the venture—which helped produce the $163 million (worldwide box office gross)and HBO documentary—at a $725 million valuation. James of course remains the biggest shareholder. \"Screen time: James has two dozen acting credits per IMDb most notably as the star of 2021s Space Jam: A New Legacy.\" Named for the Akron Ohio apartment complex where James and his mother finally found stability SpringHill combined three companies into one: James’ Robot Company marketing agency athlete platform Uninterrupted and SpringHill Entertainment founded in 2007 as a production vehicle for the award-winning documentary about James’ high school years. In 2020 James and Carter rolled everything into The SpringHill Company after raising $100 million from backers including James’ investment advisor Paul Wachter and Elisabeth Murdoch the daughter of News Corp billionaire Rupert Murdoch. Last October James sold a “significant minority stake” to a handful of investors including RedBird Capital Partners Fenway Sports Group Nike and Epic Games. James is the company’s largest single shareholder although his stake is believed not to exceed 50%. SpringHill which helped produce 2021’s (starring James) and a recent Netflix docuseries about tennis star Naomi Osaka is currently working on a biopic about James’ early days and a remake of the 1990 comedy slated to hit HBO Max in July. Right-hand man: James’ business partner Maverick Carter pictured on the left runs his empire. A childhood friend of James’ Carter heads The SpringHill Company and stars on its hit series The Shop. James has publicly dreamed about one day owning an NBA team. He’s well on his way. The basketball star already counts pro baseball soccer and hockey teams among his holdings. James grabbed a minority stake in Liverpool F.C. the English Premier League soccer team in 2011 when his sports marketing business entered into a partnership with Fenway Sports Group. Last year he and Maverick Carter exchanged their stakes in Liverpool for part-ownership of FSG. James is estimated to own around 1% of the group which owns the Boston Red Sox Fenway Park and Liverpool plus half of Roush Fenway Racing and 80% of the New England Sports Network. In late 2021 FSG agreed to to add the NHL’s Pittsburgh Penguins to its portfolio. James has lived like a billionaire for years. He owns at least three properties worth about $80 million in all. He built a $10 million mansion near his hometown of Akron Ohio. He bought an eight-bedroom spread in Los Angeles’ tony Brentwood neighborhood in 2017 for $23 million. His latest splurge: a 13000-square-foot Beverly Hills mansion. James paid $36.75 million for which he has already torn down to replace with a mansion of his own. James has been all-in on Blaze Pizza for years even and to promote the brand. His enthusiasm is understandable. He reportedly paid for a 10% slice of the made-to-order assembly-line-style pizza chain in 2012; it’s since grown to more than 300 company-owned and franchised stores throughout the U.S. and Canada. estimates James’ stake in the chain—plus his small cut of 18 Blaze franchise stores in Florida and Illinois that are run by restaurateur Larry Levy—is worth about $30 million. It’s expensive to live like LeBron but even after accounting for managers agents lawyers and a superstar’s spending habits still believes James has more than a half-billion dollars in net assets beyond what’s listed above. This includes proceeds from major scores like the $3 billion sale of Beats by Dre to Apple in 2014 (James was a spokesperson and owned a small sliver) and shares of publicly traded fitness company Beachbody which acquired Ladder the sports nutrition company James cofounded with Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2020 for $28 million in stock.]\n",

It is notable for its size with the largest preserved female specimen measuring 5.83xa0m (19.1xa0ft) in length and 2000xa0kg (4400xa0lb) in weight at maturity.However most are smaller; males measure 3.4 to 4.0xa0m (11 to 13xa0ft) and females measure 4.6 to 4.9xa0m (15 to 16xa0ft) on average.According to a 2014 study the lifespan of great white sharks is estimated to be as long as 70 years or more well above previous estimatesmaking it one of the longest lived currently known.According to the same study male great white sharks take 26 years to reach sexual maturity while the females take 33 years to be ready to produce offspring.Great white sharks can swim at speeds of 25xa0km/h (16xa0mph)for short bursts and to depths of 1200xa0m (3900xa0ft).The great white shark is an as it has no known natural predators other than on very rare occasions the. \" It is arguably the worlds largest-known extant macropredatory fish and is one of the primary predators of \"up to the size of large baleen whales. This shark is also known to prey upon a variety of other marine animals including and. It is the only known surviving of its and is responsible for more recorded human bite incidents than any other shark.The species faces numerous ecological challenges which has resulted in international protection. The lists the great white shark as aand it is included in Appendix II of.It is also protected by several national governments such as (as of 2018).Due to their need to travel long distances for seasonal migration and extremely demanding diet it is not logistically feasible to keep great white sharks in captivity; because of this while attempts have been made to do so in the past there are no known in the world believed to house a live specimen.The novel by and its subsequent by depicted the great white shark as a ferocious. Humans are not a preferred prey of the great white sharkbut the great white is nevertheless responsible for the largest number of reported and identified fatal unprovoked on humans although this happens very rarely (typically fewer than 10 times a year globally).The great white is the sole recognized extant species in the genus and is one of five extant species belonging to the.Other members of this family include the and. The family belongs to the the of mackerel sharks.The\" name white shark and its \" \" variant white pointer\" \" is thought to have come from the sharks stark white underside a characteristic feature most noticeable in beached sharks lying upside down with their bellies exposed.\"Colloquial use favours the name ‘great white shark’ perhaps because ‘great’ stresses the size and prowess of the species.Another reason might be that \"white shark\" was a term historically used to describe the and thus being much larger than the latter shark it was named \"Great\" as the \"white\" part of its name was already used for another shark which was subsequently referred to as the \"lesser white shark\". Most scientists prefer ‘white shark’ due to the fact the name \"lesser white shark\" is no longer used.Some use ‘white shark’ to refer to all members of the Lamnidae.The scientific genus name literally means \"jagged tooth\" a reference to the large serrations that appear in the sharks teeth. Broken down it is a portmanteau of two words. The prefix is derived from ( ) which means \"jagged\" or \"sharp\". The suffix is a of ( ) awhich translates to \"tooth\". The is a Latinization of ( ) the Ancient Greek word for shark. The great white shark was one of the species originally described by in his 1758 in which it was identified as an and assigned the scientific name being the genus that he placed all sharks in.By the 1810s it was recognized that the shark should be placed in a new genus but it was not until 1838 when coined the name as the new genus.There have been a few attempts to describe and classify the great white before Linnaeus. One of its earliest mentions in literature as a distinct type of animal appears in\"s 1553 book \" . In it he illustrated and described the shark under the name based on the jagged nature of its teeth and its alleged similarities with.Another name used for the great white around this time was first coined by in his 1554 book who also identified it as the fish that swallowed the prophet in biblical texts.Linnaeus recognized both names as previous classifications.studies published between 1988 and 2002 determined the closest living relative of the great white to be the mako sharks of the genus which diverged some time between 60 to 43 million years ago.Tracing this evolutionary relationship through evidence however remains subject to further study.\"The original hypothesis of the great white sharks origin held that it is a descendant of a lineage of \"and is closely related to the prehistoric.These sharks were considerably larger in size with megalodon attaining an estimated length of up to 14.2–16xa0m (47–52xa0ft).Similarities between the teeth of great white and mega-toothed sharks such as large triangular shapes serrated blades and the presence of dental bands led the primary evidence of a close evolutionary relationship. As a result scientists classified the ancient forms under the genus. Although weaknesses in the hypothesis existed such as uncertainty over exactly which species evolved into the modern great white and multiple gaps in the fossil record paleontologists were able to chart the hypothetical lineage back to a 60-million-year-old shark known as as the common ancestor of all sharks within the Lamnidae.However it is now understood that the great white shark holds closer ties to the mako sharks and is descended from a separate lineage as a unrelated to the mega-toothed sharks.This was proven with the discovery of a that connected the great white to an unserrated shark known as.This transitional species which was named in 2012 demonstrated a mosaic of evolutionary transitions between the great white and namely the gradual appearance of serrationsin a span of between 8 to 5 million years ago.The progression of characterized shifting diets and niches; by 6.5 million years ago the serrations were developed enough for to handle marine mammals.Although both the great white and were known worldwideis primarily found in and surrounding coastal depositsindicating that the great white had origins.continued to thrive alongside the great white until its last appearance around one million years agoand is believed to have possibly sired a number of additional species including and.However Yun argued that the tooth fossil remains of and Great White Shark \"have been documented from the same deposits hence the former cannot be a chronospecific ancestor of the latter.\" He also criticized that the \"morphotype has never been tested through phylogenetic analyses\" and denoted that as of 2021 the argument that the modern Carcharodon lineage with narrow serrated teeth evolved from with a broad unserrated teeth is uncertain.Tracing beyond another prevailing hypothesis proposes that the great white and mako lineages shared a common ancestor in a primitive mako-like species.The identity of this ancestor is still debated but a potential species includes which lived between 65 to 55 million years ago. It is hypothesized that the great white and mako lineages split with the rise of two separate descendants the one representing the great white shark lineage being.Great white sharks live in almost all coastal and offshore waters which have water temperature between 12 and 24xa0°C (54 and 75xa0°F) with greater concentrations in the (and) and the including and.One of the densest-known populations is found around.Juvenile great white sharks inhabit a more narrow band of temperatures (between 14 and 24xa0°C (57 and 75xa0°F)) in shallow coastal nurseries.Increased observation of young sharks in areas they were not previously common such as on the coast suggest climate change may be reducing the range of juvenile great white sharks and shifting it toward the poles.The great white is an fish observed mostly in the presence of rich game such as (ssp.) other sharks and large bony fish species. In the open ocean it has been recorded at depths as great as 1200xa0m (3900xa0ft).These findings challenge the traditional notion that the great white is a coastal species.According to a recent study great whites have migrated to an area between and known as the\" to spend at least 100 days before migrating back to Baja. On the journey out they swim slowly and dive down to around 900xa0m (3000xa0ft). After they arrive they change behaviour and do short dives to about 300xa0m (980xa0ft) for up to ten minutes. Another white shark that was tagged off the South African coast swam to the southern coast of Australia and back within the year. A similar study tracked a different great white shark from South Africa swimming to Australias northwestern coast and back a journey of 20000xa0km (12000xa0mi; 11000xa0nmi) in under nine months.\" These observations argue against traditional theories that white sharks are coastal territorial predators and open up the possibility of interaction between shark populations that were previously thought to have been discrete. The reasons for their migration and what they do at their destination is still unknown. Possibilities include seasonal feeding or mating.In the Northwest Atlantic the white shark populations off the New England coast were nearly eradicated due to over-fishing.In recent years the populations have grown greatlylargely due to the increase in seal populations on since the enactment of the in 1972.Currently very little is known about the hunting and movement patterns of great whites off Cape Cod but ongoing studies hope to offer insight into this growing shark population.The Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries (part of the) began a population study in 2014; since 2019 this research has focused on how humans can avoid conflict with sharks.A 2018 study indicated that white sharks prefer to congregate deep in in the. The sharks studied tended to favour the warm-water eddies spending the daytime hours at 450 meters and coming to the surface at night.The great white shark has a robust large conical snout. The upper and lower on the tail fin are approximately the same size which is similar to some. A great white displays\" by having a white underside and a grey dorsal area (sometimes in a brown or blue shade) that gives an overall mottled appearance. The coloration makes it difficult for prey to spot the shark because it breaks up the sharks outline when seen from the side. From above the darker shade blends with the sea and from below it exposes a minimal silhouette against the sunlight. \"is extremely rare in this species but has been documented in one great white shark (a pup that washed ashore in Australia and died).Great white sharks like many other sharks have rows of behind the main ones ready to replace any that break off. When the shark bites it shakes its head side-to-side helping the teeth saw off large chunks of flesh.Great white sharks like other mackerel sharks have larger eyes than other shark species in proportion to their body size. The iris of the eye is a deep blue instead of black.In great white sharks is present and females are generally larger than males. Male great whites on average measure 3.4 to 4.0xa0m (11 to 13xa0ft) long while females at 4.6 to 4.9xa0m (15 to 16xa0ft).Adults of this species weigh 522–771xa0kg (1151–1700xa0lb) on average;however mature females can have an average mass of 680–1110xa0kg (1500–2450xa0lb).The largest females have been verified up to 6.1xa0m (20xa0ft) in length and an estimated 1905xa0kg (4200xa0lb) in weightperhaps up to 2268xa0kg (5000xa0lb).The maximum size is subject to debate because some reports are rough estimations or speculations performed under questionable circumstances.Among living only the ( ) the ( ) and the ( ) in that order are on average larger and heavier. These three species are generally quite docile in disposition and given to passively on very small organisms.This makes the great white shark the largest extant macropredatory fish. Great white sharks are at around 1.2xa0m (3.9xa0ft) when born and grow about 25xa0cm (9.8xa0in) each year.A complete female great white shark specimen in Museum of Zoology in Lausanne claimed by De Maddalena (2003) as the largest preserved specimen measured 5.83xa0m (19.1xa0ft) in total body length when the caudal fin is in depressed position and is estimated to have weighed 2000xa0kg (4400xa0lb).According to J.xa0E. Randall the largest white shark reliably measured was a 5.94xa0m (19.5xa0ft) individual reported from in 1987;however it is not clear whether this total length is obtained when the caudal fin is in depressed position or natural position.Another great white specimen of similar size has been verified by the Canadian Shark Research Center: A female caught by David McKendrick of in August 1988 in the off Prince Edward Island. This female great white was 6.1xa0m (20xa0ft) long.However there was a report considered reliable by some experts in the past of a larger great white shark specimen from Cuba in 1945.This specimen was reportedly 6.4xa0m (21xa0ft) long and had a body mass estimated at 3324xa0kg (7328xa0lb).However later studies also revealed that this particular specimen was actually around 4.9xa0m (16xa0ft) in length a specimen in the average maximum size range.The largest great white recognized by the (IGFA) is one caught by Alf Dean in south Australian waters in 1959 weighing 1208xa0kg (2663xa0lb).A number of very large unconfirmed great white shark specimens have been recorded.For decades many works as well as the listed two great white sharks as the largest individuals: In the 1870s a 10.9xa0m (36xa0ft) great white captured in waters near and an 11.3xa0m (37xa0ft) shark trapped in a in in the 1930s. However these measurements were not obtained in a rigorous scientifically valid manner and researchers have questioned the reliability of these measurements for a long time noting they were much larger than any other accurately reported sighting. Later studies proved these doubts to be well-founded. This New Brunswick shark may have been a misidentified as the two have similar body shapes. The question of the Port Fairy shark was settled in the 1970s when J.xa0E. Randall examined the sharks jaws and \"found that the Port Fairy shark was of the order of 5xa0m (16xa0ft) in length and suggested that a mistake had been made in the original record in 1870 of the sharks length\".While these measurements have not been confirmed some great white sharks caught in modern times have been estimated to be more than 7xa0m (23xa0ft) longbut these claims have received some criticism.However J.xa0E. Randall believed that great white shark may have exceeded 6.1xa0m (20xa0ft) in length.A great white shark was captured near in on 1 April 1987. This shark was estimated to be more than 6.9xa0m (23xa0ft) long by Peter Resileyand has been designated as KANGA.Another great white shark was caught in by Alfredo Cutajar on 16 April 1987. This shark was also estimated to be around 7.13xa0m (23.4xa0ft) long by John Abela and has been designated as MALTA.However Cappo drew criticism because he used shark size estimation methods proposed by J.xa0E. Randall to suggest that the KANGA specimen was 5.8–6.4xa0m (19–21xa0ft) long.In a similar fashion I.xa0K. Fergusson also used shark size estimation methods proposed by J.xa0E. Randall to suggest that the MALTA specimen was 5.3–5.7xa0m (17–19xa0ft) long. \" However photographic evidence suggested that these specimens were larger than the size estimations yielded through Randalls methods.\"Thus a team of scientists—H.xa0F. Mollet G.xa0M. Cailliet A.xa0P. Klimley D.xa0A. Ebert A.xa0D. Testi and—reviewed the cases of the KANGA and MALTA specimens in 1996 to resolve the dispute by conducting a comprehensive analysis of the remains of these sharks and re-examination of photographic evidence in an attempt to validate the original size estimations and their findings were consistent with them. The findings indicated that estimations by P.xa0Resiley and J.xa0Abela are reasonable and could not be ruled out.A particularly large female great white nicknamed \"Deep Blue\" estimated measuring at 6.1xa0m (20xa0ft) was filmed off Guadalupe during shooting for the 2014 episode of \"Jaws Strikes Back\". Deep Blue would also later gain significant attention when she was filmed interacting with researcher Mauricio Hoyas Pallida in a viral video that Mauricio posted on on 11 June 2015.Deep Blue was later seen off Oahu in January 2019 while scavenging a sperm whale carcass whereupon she was filmed swimming beside divers including dive tourism operator and model in open water.A particularly infamous great white shark supposedly of record proportions once patrolled the area that comprises South Africa was said to be well over 7xa0m (23xa0ft) during the early 1980s. This shark known locally as the \"Submarine\" had a legendary reputation that was supposedly well-founded. Though rumours have stated this shark was exaggerated in size or non-existent altogether witness accounts by the then young Craig Anthony Ferreira a notable shark expert in South Africa and his father indicate an unusually large animal of considerable size and power (though it remains uncertain just how massive the shark was as it escaped capture each time it was hooked). Ferreira describes the four encounters with the giant shark he participated in with great detail in his book \"Great White Sharks On Their Best Behavior\".One contender in maximum size among the predatory sharks is the ( ). While tiger sharks which are typically both a few feet smaller and have a leaner less heavy body structure than white sharks have been confirmed to reach at least 5.5xa0m (18xa0ft) in the length an unverified specimen was reported to have measured 7.4xa0m (24xa0ft) in length and weighed 3110xa0kg (6860xa0lb) more than two times heavier than the largest confirmed specimen at 1524xa0kg (3360xa0lb).Some other macropredatory sharks such as the ( ) and the ( ) are also reported to rival these sharks in length (but probably weigh a bit less since they are more slender in build than a great white) in exceptional cases.Great white sharks like all other sharks have an extra sense given by the which enables them to detect the electromagnetic field emitted by the movement of living animals. Great whites are so sensitive they can detect variations of half a billionth of a. At close range this allows the shark to locate even immobile animals by detecting their heartbeat. \" Most fish have a less-developed but similar sense using their bodys \" .To more successfully hunt fast and agile prey such as sea lions the great white has adapted to maintain a body temperature warmer than the surrounding water. One of these adaptations is a \" \" (Latin for \"wonderful net\"). This close web-like structure of veins and arteries located along each lateral side of the shark conserves heat by warming the cooler arterial blood with the venous blood that has been warmed by the working muscles. This keeps certain parts of the body (particularly the stomach) at temperatures up to 14xa0°C (25xa0°F)\" above that of the surrounding water while the heart and gills remain at sea temperature. When conserving energy the core body temperature can drop to match the surroundings. A great white sharks success in raising its \"is an example of. Therefore the great white shark can be considered an or because its body temperature is not constant but is internally regulated.Great whites also rely on the fat and oils stored within their livers for long-distance migrations across nutrient-poor areas of the oceans. \" Studies by Stanford University and the Monterey Bay Aquarium published on 17 July 2013 revealed that in addition to controlling the sharks buoyancy the liver of great whites is essential in migration patterns. Sharks that sink faster during drift dives were revealed to use up their internal stores of energy quicker than those which sink in a dive at more leisurely rates.\"Toxicity from heavy metals seems to have little negative effects on great white sharks. Blood samples taken from forty-three individuals of varying size age and sex off the South African coast led by biologists from the University of Miami in 2012 indicates that despite high levels of mercury lead and arsenic there was no sign of raised white blood cell count and granulate to lymphocyte ratios indicating the sharks had healthy immune systems. This discovery suggests a previously unknown physiological defence against heavy metal poisoning. Great whites are known to have a propensity for \"self-healing and avoiding age-related ailments\".A 2007 study from the in used\" of a sharks skull and computer models to measure the sharks maximum bite force. The study reveals the forces and behaviours its skull is adapted to handle and resolves competing theories about its feeding behaviour.\" \" In 2008 a team of scientists led by Stephen Wroe conducted an experiment to determine the great white sharks jaw power and findings indicated that a specimen massing 3324xa0kg (7328xa0lb) could exert a bite force of 18216 \"(4095xa0 ).\"This sharks behaviour and social structure are complex.\"In South Africa white sharks have a\" depending on the size sex and squatters rights: Females dominate males larger sharks dominate smaller sharks and residents dominate newcomers. When hunting great whites tend to separate and resolve conflicts with rituals and displays. White sharks rarely resort to combat although some individuals have been found with bite marks that match those of other white sharks. This suggests that when a great white approaches too closely to another they react with a warning bite. Another possibility is that white sharks bite to show their dominance. Data acquired from animal-borne telemetry receivers and published in 2022 via the journal \"suggests that individual great whites may associate so that they can inadvertently share information on the whereabouts of prey or the location of the remains of animals that can be scavenged. As biologging can help to reveal social habits it allows a better understanding to be made in future studies regarding the full extent of social interactions in large marine animals including the great white shark.The great white shark is one of only a few sharks known to regularly lift its head above the sea surface to gaze at other objects such as prey. This is known as. This behaviour has also been seen in at least one group of but this might be learned from interaction with humans (it is theorized that the shark may also be able to smell better this way because smell travels through air faster than through water). White sharks are generally very curious animals display intelligence and may also turn to socializing if the situation demands it. At Seal Island white sharks have been observed arriving and departing in stable \"clans\" of two to six individuals on a yearly basis. Whether clan members are related is unknown but they get along peacefully enough. In fact the social structure of a clan is probably most aptly compared to that of a wolf pack; in that each member has a clearly established rank and each clan has an alpha leader. When members of different clans meet they establish social rank nonviolently through any of a variety of interactions.In 2022 research in suggested that the great white shark has the ability to change colours to camouflage itself depending on the hormones it gives off. Different hormones would change the colour of the skin from white to grey. Skin when dosed with would turn the skin lighter with the causing the\" cells to dissipate making the sharks skin a dark colour. Although their ability to change colour depending on the hormones is not fully validated due to the limited number of great white sharks.\"The camo shark hypothesis is supported by the fact that zebra sharks can change their colour as they age and rainbow sharks can lose colour due to stress and aging.Great white sharks are and prey upon (e.g. other)(i.e.) (e.g.and)( ) and.Great whites have also been known to eat objects that they are unable to digest. Juvenile white sharks predominantly prey on fish including other as their jaws are not strong enough to withstand the forces required to attack larger prey such as pinnipeds and cetaceans until they reach a length of 3xa0m (9.8xa0ft) or more at which point their jaw cartilage mineralizes enough to withstand the impact of biting into larger prey species.Upon approaching a length of nearly 4xa0m (13xa0ft) great white sharks begin to target predominantly for food though individual sharks seem to specialize in different types of prey depending on their preferences.They seem to be highly opportunistic.These sharks prefer prey with a high content of energy-rich fat. Shark expert Peter Klimley used a rod-and-reel rig and trolled carcasses of a seal a pig and a sheep from his boat in the South. The sharks attacked all three baits but rejected the sheep carcass.Off of in South Africa the sharks ambush ( ) from below at high speeds hitting the seal mid-body. They achieve high speeds that allow them to completely breach the surface of the water. The peak burst speed is estimated to be above 40xa0km/h (25xa0mph).They have also been observed chasing prey after a missed attack. Prey is usually attacked at the surface.Shark attacks occur most often in the morning within two hours of sunrise when visibility is poor. Their success rate is 55% in the first two hours falling to 40% in late morning after which hunting stops.Off California sharks immobilize ( \") with a large bite to the hindquarters (which is the main source of the seals mobility) and wait for the seal to bleed to death. This technique is especially used on adult male elephant seals which are typically larger than the shark ranging between 1500 and 2000xa0kg (3300 and 4400xa0lb) and are potentially dangerous adversaries.\"Most commonly though juvenile elephant seals are the most frequently eaten at elephant seal colonies.Prey is normally attacked sub-surface. ( ) are taken from the surface and dragged down until they stop struggling. They are then eaten near the bottom. ( ) are ambushed from below and struck mid-body before being dragged and eaten.In the Northwest Atlantic mature great whites are known to feed on both and seals.Unlike adults juvenile white sharks in the area feed on smaller fish species until they are large enough to prey on marine mammals such as seals.White sharks also attack dolphins and porpoises from above behind or below to avoid being detected by their. Targeted species include ( )( )(ssp.)(ssp.)( )and ( ).Groups of dolphins have occasionally been observed defending themselves from sharks with mobbing behaviour.White shark predation on other species of small cetacean has also been observed. In August 1989 a 1.8xa0m (5.9xa0ft) juvenile male ( ) was found stranded in central California with a bite mark on its from a great white shark.In addition white sharks attack and prey upon.Cases where an adult ( ) with a mean mass of around 1100xa0kg (2400xa0lb)and a juvenile ( ) an individual estimated at 3xa0m (9.8xa0ft) were hunted and killed by great white sharks have also been observed.When hunting sea turtles they appear to simply bite through the carapace around a flipper immobilizing the turtle. The heaviest species of bony fish the ( ) has been found in great white shark stomachs.Whale carcasses comprise an important part of the diet of white sharks. However this has rarely been observed due to whales dying in remote areas. It has been estimated that 30xa0kg (66xa0lb) of whale blubber could feed a 4.5xa0m (15xa0ft) white shark for 1.5 months. Detailed observations were made of four whale carcasses in False Bay between 2000 and 2010. Sharks were drawn to the carcass by chemical and odour detection spread by strong winds. After initially feeding on the whale caudal peduncle and the sharks would investigate the carcass by slowly swimming around it and mouthing several parts before selecting a blubber-rich area. During feeding bouts of 15–20 seconds the sharks removed flesh with lateral headshakes without the protective ocular rotation they employ when attacking live prey. The sharks were frequently observed regurgitating chunks of blubber and immediately returning to feed possibly in order to replace low energy yield pieces with high energy yield pieces using their teeth as mechanoreceptors to distinguish them. After feeding for several hours the sharks appeared to become lethargic no longer swimming to the surface; they were observed mouthing the carcass but apparently unable to bite hard enough to remove flesh they would instead bounce off and slowly sink. Up to eight sharks were observed feeding simultaneously bumping into each other without showing any signs of aggression; on one occasion a shark accidentally bit the head of a neighbouring shark leaving two teeth embedded but both continued to feed unperturbed. Smaller individuals hovered around the carcass eating chunks that drifted away. Unusually for the area large numbers of sharks over five metres long were observed suggesting that the largest sharks change their behaviour to search for whales as they lose the manoeuvrability required to hunt seals. The investigating team concluded that the importance of whale carcasses particularly for the largest white sharks has been underestimated.In another documented incident white sharks were observed scavenging on a whale carcass alongside tiger sharks.In 2020 marine biologists Sasha Dines and published a documented incident in the journal\" of a group of great white sharks exhibiting pack-like behaviour successfully attacking and killing a live juvenile 7xa0m (23xa0ft) humpback whale. The sharks utilized the classic attack strategy used on pinnipeds when attacking the whale even utilizing the bite-and-spit tactic they employ on smaller prey items. The whale was an entangled individual heavily emaciated and thus more vulnerable to the sharks attacks. The incident is the first known documentation of great whites actively killing a large baleen whale.\" \" A second incident regarding great white sharks killing humpback whales involving a single large female great white nicknamed Helen was documented off the coast of South Africa. Working alone the shark attacked a 33xa0ft (10xa0m) emaciated and entangled humpback whale by attacking the whales tail to cripple it before she managed to drown the whale by biting onto its head and pulling it underwater. The attack was witnessed via aerial drone by marine biologist \"who said the attack went on for roughly 50 minutes before the shark successfully killed the whale. Johnson suggested that the shark may have strategized its attack in order to kill such a large animal.Stomach contents of great whites also indicates that\" both juvenile and adult may also be included on the animals menu though whether this is active hunting or scavenging is not known at present.\"Great white sharks were previously thought to reach sexual maturity at around 15 years of age but are now believed to take far longer; male great white sharks reach sexual maturity at age 26 while females take 33 years to reach sexual maturity.Maximum life span was originally believed to be more than 30 years but a study by the\" placed it at upwards of 70 years. Examinations of vertebral growth ring count gave a maximum male age of 73 years and a maximum female age of 40 years for the specimens studied. The sharks late sexual maturity low reproductive rate long gestation period of 11 months and slow growth make it vulnerable to pressures such as overfishing and environmental change.\"\"Little is known about the great white sharks \"habits and mating behaviour had not been observed in this species until 1997 and properly documented in 2020. It was assumed previously to be possible that whale carcasses are an important location for sexually mature sharks to meet for mating.According to the testimony of fisherman Dick Ledgerwood who observed two great white sharks mating in the area near Port Chalmers and Otago Harbor in New Zealand it is theorized that great white sharks mate in shallow water away from feeding areas and continually roll belly to belly during copulation.Birth has never been observed but pregnant females have been examined. Great white sharks are which means eggs develop and hatch in the uterus and continue to develop until birth. \" The great white has an 11-month gestation period. The shark pups powerful jaws begin to develop in the first month. The unborn sharks participate in \"in which they feed on produced by the mother. Delivery is in spring and summer.The largest number of pups recorded for this species is 14 pups from a single mother measuring 4.5xa0m (15xa0ft) that was killed incidentally off Taiwan in 2019.A is the result of a high-speed approach to the surface with the resulting momentum taking the shark partially or completely clear of the water. This is a hunting technique employed by great white sharks whilst hunting seals. This technique is often used on cape fur seals at in. Because the behaviour is unpredictable it is very hard to document. It was first photographed by and Rob Lawrence who developed the technique of towing a slow-moving seal decoy to trick the sharks to breach.Between April and September scientists may observe around 600 breaches. The seals swim on the surface and the great white sharks launch their predatory attack from the deeper water below. They can reach speeds of up to 40xa0km/h (25xa0mph) and can at times launch themselves more than 3xa0m (10xa0ft) into the air. Just under half of observed breach attacks are successful.In 2011 a 3-m-long shark jumped onto a seven-person off Seal Island in Mossel Bay. The crew were undertaking a using sardines as bait and the incident was judged not to be an attack on the boat but an accident.Interspecific competition between the great white shark and the is probable in regions where dietary preferences of both species may overlap.An incident was documented on 4 October 1997 in the off in the United States. An estimated 4.7–5.3xa0m (15–17xa0ft) female orca immobilized an estimated 3–4xa0m (9.8–13.1xa0ft) great white shark.The orca held the shark upside down to induce\" and kept the shark still for fifteen minutes causing it to suffocate. The orca then proceeded to eat the dead sharks liver.\" \" It is believed that the scent of the slain sharks carcass caused all the great whites in the region to flee forfeiting an opportunity for a great seasonal feed.\"Another similar attack apparently occurred there in 2000 but its outcome is not clear.After both attacks the local population of about 100 great whites vanished.Following the 2000 incident a great white with a satellite tag was found to have immediately submerged to a depth of 500xa0m (1600xa0ft) and swum to.In 2015 a pod of orcas was recorded to have killed a great white shark off South Australia.In 2017 three great whites were found washed ashore near South Africa with their body cavities torn open and the livers removed by what is likely to have been orcas.Orcas also generally impact great white distribution. Studies published in 2019 of orca and great white shark distribution and interactions around the Farallon Islands indicate that the cetaceans impact the sharks negatively with brief appearances by orcas causing the sharks to seek out new feeding areas until the next season.It is unclear whether this is an example of or. Occasionally however some great whites have been seen to swim near orcas without fear.Of all shark species the great white shark is responsible for by far the largest number of recorded shark bite incidents on humans with 272 documented unprovoked bite incidents on humans as of 2012.More than any documented bite incident\"s best-selling novel \"and the subsequent directed by provided the great white shark with the image of being a \" \" in the public mind.While great white sharks have killed humans in at least 74 documented unprovoked bite incidents they typically do not target them: for example in the there have been 31 confirmed bite incidents against humans in the last two centuries most of which were non-fatal. Many of the incidents seemed to be \"test-bites\". Great white sharks also test-bite and other unfamiliar objects and they might grab a human or a to identify what it is. Contrary to popular belief great white sharks do not mistake humans for seals. \" Many bite incidents occur in waters with low visibility or other situations which impair the sharks senses. The species appears to not like the taste of humans or at least finds the taste unfamiliar. Further research shows that they can tell in one bite whether or not the object is worth predating upon. Humans for the most part are too bony for their liking. They much prefer seals which are fat and rich in protein.\"Studies published in 2021 by Ryan in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface suggest that mistaken identity is in fact a case for many shark bite incidents perpetrated by great white sharks. Using cameras and footage of seals in aquariums as models and mounted cameras moving at the same speed and angle as a cruising great white shark looking up at the surface from below the experiment suggests that the sharks are likely colorblind and cannot see in fine enough detail to determine whether the silhouette above them is a pinniped or a swimming human potentially vindicating the hypothesis.\"Humans are not appropriate prey because the sharks digestion is too slow to cope with a humans high ratio of bone to muscle and fat. Accordingly in most recorded shark bite incidents great whites broke off contact after the first bite. Fatalities are usually caused by blood loss from the initial bite rather than from critical organ loss or from whole consumption. From 1990 to 2011 there have been a total of 139 unprovoked great white shark bite incidents 29 of which were fatal.\"However some researchers have hypothesized that the reason the proportion of fatalities is low is not that sharks do not like human flesh but because humans are often able to escape after the first bite. In the 1980s John McCosker chair of aquatic biology at the noted that divers who dived solo and were bitten by great whites were generally at least partially consumed while divers who followed the buddy system were generally rescued by their companion. McCosker and Timothy C. Tricas an author and professor at the\" suggest that a standard pattern for great whites is to make an initial devastating attack and then wait for the prey to weaken before consuming the wounded animal. Humans ability to move out of reach with the help of others thus foiling the attack is unusual for a great whites prey.\" is the deliberate killing of sharks by a government in an attempt to reduce; shark culling is often called \"shark control\".These programs have been criticized by environmentalists and scientists—they say these programs harm the; they also say such programs are \"outdated cruel and ineffective\".Many different species (etc.) are also killed in these programs (because of their use of and\")—15135 marine animals were killed in New South Wales nets between 1950 and 2008\"and 84000 marine animals were killed by Queensland authorities from 1962 to 2015.Great white sharks are currently killed in both and in \"shark control\" (shark culling) programs.Queensland uses and while New South Wales only uses nets. From 1962 to 2018 Queensland authorities killed about 50000 sharks many of which were great whites.From 2013 to 2014 alone 667 sharks were killed by Queensland authorities including great white sharks.In Queensland great white sharks found alive on the drum lines are shot.In New South Wales between 1950 and 2008 a total of 577 great white sharks were killed in.Between September 2017 and April 2018 fourteen great white sharks were killed in New South Wales. (an area of) also has a \"shark control\" program that kills great white sharks and other marine life. In a 30-year period more than 33000 sharks were killed in KwaZulu-Natals shark-killing program including great whites.In 2014 the state government of led by Premier implemented a. The policy colloquially referred to as the was intended to protect users of the marine environment from shark bite incidents following the deaths of seven people on the in the years 2010–2013.Baited were deployed near popular beaches using hooks designed to catch great white sharks as well as and. Large sharks found hooked but still alive were shot and their bodies discarded at sea.The government claimed they were not the sharks but were using a \"targeted localised hazard mitigation strategy\".Barnett described opposition as \"ludicrous\" and \"extreme\" and said that nothing could change his mind.This policy was met with widespread condemnation from the scientific community which showed that species responsible for bite incidents were notoriously hard to identify that the drum lines failed to capture white sharks as intended and that the government also failed to show any correlation between their drum line policy and a decrease in shark bite incidents in the region.Great white sharks infrequently bite and sometimes even sink boats. Only five of the 108 authenticated unprovoked shark bite incidents reported from the Pacific Coast during the 20th century involved.In a few cases they have bitten boats up to 10xa0m (33xa0ft) in length. They have bumped or knocked people overboard usually biting the boat from the stern. In one case in 1936 a large shark leapt completely into the fishing boat\" knocking a crewman into the sea. Tricas and McCoskers underwater observations suggest that sharks are attracted to boats by the electrical fields they generate which are picked up by the ampullae of Lorenzini and confuse the shark about whether or not wounded prey might be nearby.\"Prior to August 1981 no great white shark in captivity lived longer than 11 days. In August 1981 a great white survived for 16 days at before being released.The idea of containing a live great white at was used in the 1983 film.first attempted to display a great white in 1984 but the shark died after 11 days because it did not eat.In July 2003 Monterey researchers captured a small female and kept it in a large netted pen near for five days. They had the rare success of getting the shark to feed in captivity before its release.Not until September 2004 was the aquarium able to place a great white on long-term exhibit. A young female which was caught off the coast of\" was kept in the aquariums 3.8xa0millionxa0l (1xa0millionxa0USxa0gal) Outer Bay exhibit for 198 days before she was released in March 2005. She was tracked for 30 days after release.\"On the evening of 31 August 2006 the aquarium introduced a juvenile male caught outside.His first meal as a captive was a large steak on 8 September 2006 and as of that date he was estimated to be 1.72xa0m (68xa0in) in length and to weigh approximately 47xa0kg (104xa0lb). He was released on 16 January 2007 after 137 days in captivity. Monterey Bay Aquarium housed a third great white a juvenile male for 162 days between 27 August 2007 and 5 February 2008. On arrival he was 1.4xa0m (4.6xa0ft) long and weighed 30.6xa0kg (67xa0lb). He grew to 1.8xa0m (5.9xa0ft) and 64xa0kg (141xa0lb) before release. A juvenile female came to the Outer Bay Exhibit on 27 August 2008. While she did swim well the shark fed only once during her stay and was tagged and released on 7 September 2008. Another juvenile female was captured near Malibu on 12 August 2009 introduced to the Outer Bay exhibit on 26 August 2009 and was successfully released into the wild on 4 November 2009.The Monterey Bay Aquarium introduced a 1.4-m-long male into their redesigned \"Open Sea\" exhibit on 31 August 2011. He was exhibited for 55 days and was released into the wild on the 25th of October the same year. However the shark was determined to have died shortly after release via an attached electronic tag. The cause of death is not known.The Monterey Bay Aquarium does not plan to exhibit any more great whites as the main purpose of containing them was scientific. As data from captive great whites were no longer needed the institute has instead shifted its focus to study wild sharks.\"One of the largest adult great whites ever exhibited was at Japans \"in 2016 where a 3.5xa0m (11xa0ft) male was exhibited for three days before dying.Perhaps the most famous captive was a 2.4xa0m (7.9xa0ft) female named Sandy which in August 1980 became the only great white to be housed at the\" \"in California. She was released because she would not eat and constantly bumped against the walls.Due to the vast amounts of resources required and the subsequent cost to keep a great white shark alive in captivity their dietary preferences size migratory nature and the stress of capture and containment permanent exhibition of a great white shark is likely to be unfeasible.Cage diving is most common at sites where great whites are frequent including the coast of South Africa the in South Australiaand in. The popularity of cage diving and swimming with sharks is at the focus of a booming tourist industry.A common practice is to the water with pieces of fish to attract the sharks. These practices may make sharks more accustomed to people in their environment and to associate human activity with food; a potentially dangerous situation. By drawing bait on a wire towards the cage tour operators lure the shark to the cage possibly striking it exacerbating this problem. Other operators draw the bait away from the cage causing the shark to swim past the divers. At present hang baits are illegal off Isla Guadalupe and reputable dive operators do not use them. Operators in South Africa and Australia continue to use hang baits and decoys.In South Australia playing rock music recordings underwater including the album has also been used experimentally to attract sharks.Companies object to being blamed for shark bite incidents pointing out that tends to strike humans more often than sharks bite humans.Their position is that further research needs to be done before banning practices such as chumming which may alter natural behaviour.One compromise is to only use chum in areas where whites actively patrol anyway well away from human leisure areas. Also responsible dive operators do not feed sharks. Only sharks that are willing to scavenge follow the chum trail and if they find no food at the end then the shark soon swims off and does not associate chum with a meal. It has been suggested that government licensing strategies may help enforce these.Putting in the A great white shark approaches divers in a cage off Dyer Island Western Cape South Africa A great white shark approaches a cage Tourists in a cage near It is unclear how much of a concurrent increase in fishing for great white sharks has caused the decline of great white shark populations from the 1970s to the present. No accurate global population numbers are available but the great white shark is now considered.Sharks taken during the long interval between birth and sexual maturity never reproduce making population recovery and growth difficult.The notes that very little is known about the actual status of the great white shark but as it appears uncommon compared to other widely distributed species it is considered vulnerable.It is included in Appendix II ofmeaning that international trade in the species (including parts and derivatives) requires a permit.As of March 2010 it has also been included in Annex I of the which strives for increased international understanding and coordination for the protection of certain migratory sharks.A February 2010 study by of estimated the world population of great white sharks to be lower than 3500 individuals making the species more vulnerable to extinction than the whose population is in the same range.According to another study from 2014 by there are about 2000 great white sharks near the California coast which is 10 times higher than the previous estimate of 219 by.Fishermen target many sharks for their jaws teeth and fins and as game fish in general. The great white shark however is rarely an object of although its flesh is considered valuable. If casually captured (it happens for example in some in the) it is misleadingly sold as.The great white shark was declared vulnerable by the in 1999 because of significant population decline and is currently protected under the.The causes of decline prior to protection included mortality from harvests as well as being caught in beach protection netting.The national conservation status of the great white shark is reflected by all Australian states under their respective laws granting the species full protection throughout Australia regardless of jurisdiction.Many states had prohibited the killing or possession of great white sharks prior to national legislation coming into effect. The great white shark is further listed as threatened in under the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act and as rare or likely to become extinct under Schedule 5 of the Wildlife Conservation Act in.In 2002 the Australian government created the White Shark Recovery Plan implementing government-mandated conservation research and monitoring for conservation in addition to federal protection and stronger regulation of shark-related trade and tourism activities.An updated recovery plan was published in 2013 to review progress research findings and to implement further conservation actions. \" A study in 2012 revealed that Australias white shark population was separated by \"into eastern and western populations indicating a need for the development of regional conservation strategies.Presently human-caused shark mortality is continuing primarily from accidental and illegal catching in commercial and recreational fishing as well as from being caught in beach protection netting and the populations of great white shark in Australia are yet to recover.In spite of official protections in Australia great white sharks continue to be killed in state \"shark control\" programs within Australia. For example the government of has a \"shark control\" program ( ) which kills great white sharks (as well as other marine life) using and.In Queensland great white sharks that are found alive on the baited hooks are shot.The government of also kills great white sharks in its \"shark control\" program.Partly because of these programs shark numbers in eastern Australia have decreased.The Australasian population of great white sharks is believed to be in excess of 8000–10000 individuals according to genetic research studies done by with an adult population estimated to be around 2210 individuals in both and. The annual survival rate for juveniles in these two separate populations was estimated in the same study to be close to 73 percent while adult sharks had a 93 percent annual survival rate. Whether or not mortality rates in great white sharks have declined or the population has increased as a result of the protection of this species in Australian waters is as yet unknown due to the slow growth rates of this species.As of April 2007 great white sharks were fully protected within 370xa0km (230xa0mi) of New Zealand and additionally from fishing by New Zealand-flagged boats outside this range. The maximum penalty is a $250000 fine and up to six months in prison.In June 2018 the New Zealand classified the great white shark under the as \"Nationally Endangered\". The species meets the criteria for this classification as there exists a moderate stable population of between 1000 and 5000 mature individuals. This classification has the qualifiers \"Data Poor\" and \"Threatened Overseas\".In 2013 great white sharks were added to. From data collected the population of great whites in the North Pacific was estimated to be fewer than 340 individuals. Research also reveals these sharks are genetically distinct from other members of their species elsewhere in Africa Australia and the east coast of North America having been isolated from other populations.A 2014 study estimated the population of great white sharks along the California coastline to be approximately 2400.In 2015 Massachusetts banned catching cage diving feeding towing decoys or baiting and chumming for its significant and highly predictable migratory great white population without an appropriate research permit. The goal of these restrictions is to both protect the sharks and public health.]'"

        "article = \"\"\" It’s 1993 and an addict is tending bar, probably the worst possible job for an addict besides, maybe, professional basketball player in the 1970s.\n",
        "Daniel “Gus” Gerard is behind the bar at the dive, Spinnakers, in the rural anonymity of Madison, Ohio, his 6-foot-8 frame bending and reaching for empty glasses sitting about twice as far away as any other bartender in North America could reach. As the crowd starts filing in, Gus becomes the star of the show, cranking the jukebox and encouraging everyone to dance and have a good time. He pours drinks freely—the locally infamous Gus-a-Roo special that has varying ingredients from night to night—occasionally taking a quick break in the back of the bar to do lines and key bumps with the small-time coke dealers who had come to see him.\n",
        "He’s just been thrown out of his brother’s house. He went to live there after the money from his ABA and NBA contracts dried up, and after he tried and failed to clean up for his wife—his first-ever girlfriend, his college sweetheart—and his children. His wife’s family held an intervention for him after he’d been forced to sell his home in Virginia before the bank foreclosed on it, and his wife told him he had one more chance to kick his addictions. He didn’t, and he arrived home one day to an empty house and a note on the table telling him to pack his things. He would be allowed to see his kids again, the note said, if and only if he ever got clean. He wasn’t planning on that, so he got his stuff and left.\n",
        "Six hours later, he arrived at his brother’s home. It didn’t last long. He got home drunk and high and loud in the middle of the night one time too often, and his brother told him to get out. He needed help. Please, let us get you some help. We love you. Your children love you. Please.\n",
        "Gus gets a job at the bar, instead. It’s the perfect gig for someone like him, someone who likes to drink until he can’t stand up and snort coke until he can again. A job where he can pour drinks for customers, party all the time—and get paid for it—and be close to drug dealers. That’s what he needs. He doesn’t need help, he just needs more friends. He needs people who understand him and like to be around him, feeding off of his larger-than-life personality. Sucking up his energy. The bar owners don’t care. They see the crowds who gather for the sinewy-framed star with a smile as bright as the lights he used to play under. He’s a genius with people and instantly likable. If some of the customers he’s bringing in are taking him away for a moment to feed his growing hunger, they still pay their bar tab every night. And Gus gets more energy every time he disappears for a few minutes, pouring drinks even faster and racking up even larger tabs and tips for everyone working.\n",
        "Now it’s Christmas. He’s alone. He gets to talk to his kids on the phone and they tell him about their lives, what’s happening in school. They ask when they can see him and he tells them soon. He tells his ex-wife—they’ve divorced now, though Gus never bothered to show up for the divorce hearings and a warrant was issued for his arrest—that he will send gifts to the children. She knows he won’t, and so does he. When they hang up, he puts his nose to a line of coke on the table so that he can try to forget what just happened. It works, that time.\n",
        "Now it’s one of his kids’ birthdays. They have the same conversation. He makes the same promises. He puts his nose to the table again when they hang up, and it still works, but not as well as it used to.\n",
        "Now it’s the other kid’s birthday. And when he goes to the table this time it doesn’t work at all. In fact, it makes it worse. So, Gus makes what he thinks is the rational choice. He scoops up as much cocaine as he can—from the table, from the bedroom, from the kitchen—grabs a handle of vodka, heads to his car. For two days he drives around, deciding how to kill himself.\n",
        "Daniel Gerard was born and raised in Uniontown, Pennsylvania—not too far from Pittsburgh, not too far from Morgantown. Coal and steel country. His father was a long-haul truck driver, meaning he wasn’t around much during the week, so they bonded on the weekends, watching the Sunday basketball broadcast. Being the ‘60s, it was usually the Celtics and the Sixers, or the Celtics and the Lakers.\n",
        "One day, Gus decided to teach his son how to play, so he nailed a piece of plywood with a rim to a shed out back. Once it was finished, he threw up a hook shot from about 15 feet away, and the rim came crashing down. His son cried, the new basket destroyed before he’d even had a chance to take a shot. So, Gus took his son to the nearby playground, putting his trust in the public works budget to make rims that would hold up a little better.\n",
        "Daniel went to the playground every day, often by himself, just dribbling and shooting. He was already lanky and still uncoordinated, growing faster than his brain could keep up with, and he wore massive, thick glasses. He fell over himself, he missed more than he made, but he loved the game. He would shovel out the court on wintry days so that he could keep playing. If his coordination was poor, his vertical leap was coming along, developed climbing hills doing a paper route on the steep O’Connell Avenue. When the time came in junior high, he decided to go out for the eighth-grade team.\n",
        "He didn’t have his own bag or gear, so his father gave him his old stuff from his high school playing days. Embroidered on his father’s old bag was his name, “Gus,” so when Daniel showed up to tryouts, he became a “Gus” too. Being the tallest kid there, he made the team.\n",
        "As his coordination caught up to his growth spurts, he started showing dominance in the competitive Western Pennsylvania high school basketball scene. During one junior varsity game, he was pulled at halftime. Gus was down on himself, assuming he did something wrong, but the varsity coach came to him in the locker room and told him to get changed. He was playing varsity that night, and he was going to start. He had 35 points and 19 rebounds.\n",
        "Western Pennsylvania is not really known for its basketball anymore, but in the ‘60s and ‘70s, when industry was still booming and the population was more than double what it is today, things were much different. Laurel Highlands alone had produced multiple D1 basketball players, including the great Wil Robinson, who went on to West Virginia and broke Jerry West’s single season PPG record with 29.4. A few miles down the road, Uniontown High School was pumping out D1 talent including Stu Lantz, the leading scorer for the undefeated 1964 state championship team and a future NBAer. And, of course, 50 miles north was Pittsburgh itself, churning out stars like Maurice Lucas, Ken Durett, George Karl, and Walter Szczerbiak.\n",
        "Always a shy kid, Daniel hadn’t had many friends at school, and while the bullying wasn’t torturous, it ate at him that he never got invited to sit with the cooler kids at lunch. That all changed once basketball intervened. No longer the gangly introvert picked on for his lack of coordination and thick glasses, Gus was now an in-demand future local legend. Alumni complimented his game and thanked him for carrying the legacy, pushing him to be better. He had friends, real friends, and wouldn’t have to play at the playground near his home by himself anymore. Basketball had given him a sense of community he didn’t have before, with a home that was often half-empty while his father worked and a school that had previously ostracized him. That’s when the partying started, though not in earnest. He would get invited places, would enjoy having the spotlight on him for a bit, smoke a little bit of weed here and there. But that’s all.\n",
        "Gus was heavily recruited, but chose the University of Virginia over North Carolina because he worried that the Tar Heels’ 1971 recruiting class that included Bob McAdoo and Bobby Jones would compromise his ability to play as soon as he would like. He was an instant star as a sophomore at Virginia (at the time, freshmen were not allowed to play varsity in D1). That’s when the partying started in earnest. Gus was invited to what felt like every single party thrown on campus, and his competitive spirit took over. He wanted to go to all of them, to be the best partier there was, to please his newfound fans and friends. Just like at the playground, he would be the first one there and the last to leave.\n",
        "During his junior year he averaged 20 and 10, second in the ACC in scoring average behind only the legendary David Thompson. In 1974 he was selected for Team USA at the World University Games, and was drafted by the Carolina Cougars of the ABA, who folded shortly thereafter and became the Spirits of St. Louis. They flew him to New York to offer him a contract: $950,000 over five years, and $75,000 just to sign his name. Gerard consulted with his high school coach, Harold “Horse” Taylor. Horse asked him how he was doing in school and, upon hearing that he had flirted with academic eligibility issues, told Gus what he already knew was true: You will never, ever make that much money doing anything else in your life. Gus signed the contract, and his professional basketball career was under way. He’d never had more than $10 in his pocket, and suddenly on paper he was nearly a millionaire.\n",
        "On the way back from New York to Uniontown, Gus stopped with his friends at a bar on Route 51. They had $12 among them, and an uncashed $75,000 check in Gus’s wallet. They asked for three six-packs to go and explained the situation: they didn’t have enough money, but they could bring more later. They just needed to celebrate. The bartender gave them the six-packs for free and told them that during his rookie year, Gus could pay for them by sending an autographed picture. That signed photo hung over the cash register in the bar until it closed 20 years later.\n",
        "By the time Gus went pro, he was into cocaine, the status drug of the ‘70s. His only rules were never during a game and never before tipoff, but everything else was fair game. According to Gerard, cocaine use in the ABA at the time was common. He definitely wasn’t the only guy on the Spirits using it. In fact, if he’d held out, he might have been the only one not using it.\n",
        "Marvin Barnes, who earned the nickname “Bad News” because of all of the trouble that chased him on and off the court, was Gerard’s favorite party mate on the Spirits. The self-proclaimed “macaroni from Providence” was the ABA Rookie of the Year, though he always told teammates that he didn’t even like basketball and just wanted to be “a pimp.” Marvin would show up to Gerard’s apartment and ask him where the weed was, and they’d light a couple of joints and relax. They’d break out the cocaine and do some lines on the table, drink a few beers. After about 90 minutes Marvin would say he had to go. He’d had a girlfriend downstairs in the car the whole time, and if he made her wait much longer than she’d be mad.\n",
        "Gus made the ABA’s All-Rookie Team that year, and was a All-Star the following season with the Denver Nuggets, who’d acquired him via trade. Larry Brown was coaching the Nuggets at the time, and had previously drafted Gerard when he was coaching the Cougars, before that team folded. Brown finally got his man, and he brought out his best two seasons in the pros—one in the ABA, and one in the NBA, after the merger.\n",
        "The merger had brought a new level of stardom for all the ABA players. They were on TV more, with recognition came status, and with status came more and bigger parties. Road trips meant visits to the hottest clubs in the biggest cities. He was with David Thompson that night at Studio 54 when an intoxicated Thompson tried to push his way past the line. The bouncer pushed him down the stairs, injuring his leg and ending his career.\n",
        "David was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, Gus figured. It could happen to anyone.\n",
        "After being traded to the tanking Buffalo Braves in 1976, Gus continued to bounce around the league, his addiction largely flying under the radar because he had never missed a plane, never been late for a practice, never shown any of the signs typical of an addiction consuming someone’s life. He hated his time in Buffalo and demanded a trade so he could get more playing time, landing in Detroit—ironically enough, he was swapped for Marvin Barnes—to play for the famously enthusiastic shrieker, Dick Vitale. Vitale was about as well-liked by his Pistons players as he was by everyone else in America, and Gerard witnessed Bob Lanier throw a trashcan at Vitale’s head for telling him to hustle harder. Nobody told Bob Lanier what to do during training camp.\n",
        "Vitale cut Gus, and he signed with Kansas City, playing with them for a couple of seasons before being traded to the Spurs to finish out his contract. By that point, the cocaine was consuming him. His minutes per game continued to dwindle, even as his general production stayed fairly consistent in the playing time he was given. That offseason, his focus shifted away from basketball and entirely towards partying. He drove friends to Atlantic City on the weekends to gamble, paying everyone’s way. He flew around the country, drinking and snorting with teammates and friends. For the first time ever, his addictions had overtaken his love for basketball, and as a result he let himself get out of shape. The Spurs invited him to training camp in 1981 but he wasn’t the same player. They cut him loose, and his career was over.\n",
        "He was still just 28 years old, and it only took a few years for to blow through his million dollars. He’d sustained himself best he could by picking up odd jobs here and there: drywall, landscaping, moving companies, anything else that could give him a few hundred dollars to get through another month or two. The bartending job kept him afloat for four years, feeding his addiction and giving him a place to live, but the addiction caught up. Money gone, home gone, wife and kids gone. It wasn’t long before he was in a friend’s garage, ready to die.\n",
        "1993, and Gus was finished driving. It was time to get on with it. He drove to his friend’s house on the lake, a friend he knew wasn’t home. He parked in the garage and closed the garage door and rolled down his windows and let the engine run.\n",
        "Gerard still remembers what went through his mind then. He remembered beating Julius Erving’s Nets in the 1975 playoffs, an upset that shocked the league. He, Maurice Lucas, and Marvin Barnes—the first ever all-rookie frontcourt in ABA history—had needed only five games to destroy the Nets. He remembered the trips to Studio 54 with David Thompson.\n",
        "Most of all, he remembered Uniontown. His friends Leroy and Barry took him to the black side of town and told him that if he could play there, he could play anywhere. The high-flying, rim-destroying signature of Gus’s game was born on those playgrounds and the confidence and reputation from those days carried him in his career. He was the mean white boy who talked shit and would rise up and dunk on anyone, or meet them at the rim. He would’ve given given anything to be back there, instead of in a car waiting to die.\n",
        "Gus was lightheaded, a feeling he was familiar with, but there was no euphoria, no energy, not this time. He was tired. He’d been tired for so long.\n",
        "He woke up a few hours later.\n",
        "As it turned out, driving around for two days had drained his gas tank. The engine died before the fumes could kill him, and so Gus lived\n",
        "He walked into his friend’s house. On the table was an issue of Parade magazine, the cover showing John Lucas, his old teammate and roommate for the World University Games and now the head coach of the Spurs. The story was about John’s recovery from his own alcohol and cocaine addictions, and how he had opened the John Lucas Treatment Center in Houston to help other athletes with substance abuse issues. Gus called the Spurs and left a message for Lucas.\n",
        "He got a call back from George Gervin, the Iceman himself, that very night. The Spurs had just been eliminated from the playoffs on a late shot by Charles Barkley of the Suns. Gervin, an assistant coach, assured him that Lucas would call as soon as he was done with media interviews. Before Lucas had even addressed his team, he called his old friend back.\n",
        "“Will you come see me in Houston?” he asked Gus.\n",
        "“I don’t have any money,” Gus said. “I don’t have insurance. I don’t have anything. I can’t pay for rehab.”\n",
        "“Motherfucker, I didn’t ask if you had money,” Lucas said. “I asked if you would come see me.”\n",
        "So, he did. His sister bought him a one-way ticket to Houston and told him that if he got clean she’d buy him a ticket home. John Lucas was there to welcome him to his facility.\n",
        "Exercise was part of the program: swimming, running the track, playing basketball. Gus spent much of his rehab experience playing on the same practice court as members of the Houston Rockets, trying his best to keep up with Hakeem Olajuwon. He held his own, even at age 40. Hakeem did what Hakeem did to everyone, but Gus played well enough against some of the other pros that a coach for a pro team in Mexico took notice. He asked Lucas if Gus would be interested in playing for his team for the rest of the season, as the team hunted for a playoff spot. He’d pay him $12,000 in cash for the service.\n",
        "Gus was nervous. He’d only been 90 days sober at this point. Once again, Lucas was his voice of reason.\n",
        "“How much do you owe in child support?” Lucas asked.\n",
        "“About 10 grand,” Gus told him.\n",
        "“Get your ass down to Mexico. You’ll be fine. Pay your kids what you owe, and get your fresh start.”\n",
        "He didn’t speak a word of Spanish, his trip involved precarious bus rides through the hills and down dirt roads, and he had to listen to Alcoholics Anonymous tapes at full volume just to stop himself from having a panic attack on the bus, but he made it. He played the rest of that season, got his money, and made his payments.\n",
        "Gus returned to Houston and moved into a halfway house. Obsessed with his recovery—the zeal of a convert—he decided to pay his experience forward, going to work for Lucas as a counselor at his facility. And that’s what Gus Gerard did for more than a decade, counseling athletes with substance abuse issues and giving motivational speeches at companies and colleges. He could not change what he had done to himself, to his family, or to his friends. But, he could try to help steer others away from making the same mistakes. Sometimes it worked, even.\n",
        "Gus went back to Uniontown for the first time in 20 years for Horse Taylor’s court dedication at Laurel Highlands. Most of the bridges he’d burned have since been mended, a far cry from the days in the ‘80s when people would bust his windows over unpaid drug debts, or call his mother in the middle of the night to threaten her and tell her that her son was worthless. There are still some old friends who turn the other way when they see him, or people who speak ill of him when he’s not around. He can’t stop that. He doesn’t try.\n",
        "It’s 2019 in Uniontown and an addict is tending bar. Gus still has the same reach as he did in Ohio, but he is a bit slower and more deliberate with his movements. It’s a slow Tuesday, and the place is quiet, country music playing over the speakers and the Penguins game on the TVs.\n",
        "At the bar, a man with fresh stitches in his head pleads quietly with his companion. She is convinced that the tree that fell on his head that day was intentional, and that the workers on his tree trimming crew did it to send a message. He insists they offered to pay for his medicine, so they couldn’t have done it on purpose.\n",
        "This is Gus’s Pub. He owns the place. He’s still addicted—he’s accepted that he always will be—but he doesn’t use anymore. There are no more key bumps in the back. No more rowdy jukebox nights. It’s a calmer crowd here in his hometown. Gus is pouring himself a drink, but it’s a ginger ale.\n",
        "He is conflicted about the bar. When his friend offered him the space to open it up, Gus called his sponsor to ask the question that was eating at him (and still eats at him): How do I square being in recovery while distributing the same stuff that helped put me in this mess? His sponsor told him to think about the jobs he would be giving to people, and the opportunity to build a place that puts money back into the community.\n",
        "That isn’t quite enough for Gus, so he also talks. His story is widely known in Uniontown, which isn’t that big, certainly not so big people would forget a local legend. As such, his customers sometimes seek his help. A nephew is struggling with heroin addiction. A cousin drinks too much or too often. Gus will do what he can, use his connections in the recovery community to get them counseling or a spot in a rehab facility.\n",
        "His bar is his vehicle for spreading his story. It’s all he wants, for something positive to come from the darkness he faced and still faces, living his life moment to moment and only ever being able to commit to not drinking or getting high that day.\n",
        "The walls are adorned with photos of Gerard’s history—and of course, the history of his friends and teammates. There’s a signed photo of Gus guarding Julius Erving in the post. A photo of Gus, his old teammate Mike D’Antoni, and their broadcaster, Bob Costas. The biggest photo assortment, however, is the one featuring the the legends of Laurel Highlands. Wil Robinson. Jimmy Hobgood. Horse Taylor. Buzzy Harrison.\n",
        "Gerard remembers what it was like to idolize someone, to just want to fit in.\n",
        "“I was never one of the kids in school that would hang around with the cooler guys,” he tells me. His voice is heavy and slow, his eyes losing focus. “I never tried to hurt anybody, I tried to help people out. I always gave money away. If my friends in Charlottesville needed something, I gave them money. I bought my family stuff, my dad a truck, bought a friend a car.\n",
        "“I didn’t need to. People liked me. They liked me because of what I did or what I accomplished. Cocaine gave me that sense of power, or euphoria, the grandiosity it gave me. It made me feel like a king.”\n",
        "He doesn’t carry his regrets outwardly. At the bar, half the people who are there make sure they stop to chat with him when they arrive and say goodbye on the way out. He’s jovial and sweet with them, remembering their names and their families’ names. He helps players at Laurel Highlands who ask for his help. His smile, bright as it was in the glossy photos on the wall, doesn’t show pain.\n",
        "But there are regrets, one above others that eats away at him. Before he lost himself in his addiction, he had lost himself in basketball. The playground near his house was his fantasyland, where every shot he took was a last second shot to win, and every dunk was over Bill Russell or Wilt Chamberlain. On the court, the anxieties that would eventually sink him disappeared for a few hours at a time. He still loves the game, but he knows that he never got to see how far he could take his abilities.\n",
        "“I shortchanged myself. Had I gotten sober when I was playing, I maybe could’ve played 12 or 15 years,” he says. He pauses a moment, and the fire is there. “I mean, look, Larry Bird, I blocked his shot. Julius Erving. I blocked his shot. I couldn’t do all the things those guys did, but I could get up with them.”\n",
